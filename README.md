## LAMP Deploy Script for Centos 6.5/6.6 systems
Very first and 'raw' version of LAMP Deploy Script. LAMP Deploy Script - written with Python 2.7 and should run "out of the box" on Centos 6.5/6.6 systems. 


## LAMP Deploy Script V 0.1
LAMP Deploy Script was written to help web developers and any new user in Linux to deploy his own, ready to use web server. In one click user can install Apache, MySQL and PHP. 


## To Do list:
- To add full support of Centos 7 
- To add full support of Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 LTS
- To add LEMP stack (Linux, NGinx, MySQL, PHP)
- To add option '1-click install'
- To add option 'Additional tools'
- Create one binary file by using Cython library

## How-to use
For now, script contains only two files written on Python:
* RunStaFF.py
* Centos66_64bit_LAMP.py

You should run Centos66_64bit_LAMP.py to see "Welcome Screen"

## Warning, BUGZZzz
This script still conteins bugs and it need a lot of polish.
